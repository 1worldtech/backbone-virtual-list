## Build
Run `npm run build:production` to build minified production version, and  `npm run build` to build unminified - this will preserve sourcemaps and the code will be easer to debug and understand.

## TODO
* Setup test enviroment.
* Create test for basic functionalities.
* Implement option for not setting height, but using available container height.
